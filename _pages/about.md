Hi! I’m a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at Harvard University, where I am fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Milind Tambe](https://teamcore.seas.harvard.edu/tambe). My research interests lie at the intersection of Computer Science and Economics, with a particular focus on modeling strategic agents and developing learning algorithms for social good.

I earned my bachelor’s degree at Peking University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Xiaotie Deng](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/english/people/faculty/xiaotiedeng/index.htm) and Prof. [Yuqing Kong](https://cfcs.pku.edu.cn/yuqkong/). Additionally, I had a wonderful summer research experience at CMU, working with Prof. [Steven Wu](https://zstevenwu.com/), Prof. [Haifeng Xu](https://www.haifeng-xu.com/) (UChicago), and Prof. [Shuran Zheng](https://sites.google.com/view/shuran-zheng/about?authuser=0) (Tsinghua University).
